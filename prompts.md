Prompt 1: Add a 400 * 300px container, centered horizontally and vertically
Respuesta 1: I'll add a small TODO plan, then insert the HTML container and CSS to center it.

Now I'll update index.html and styles.css to add the container and centering styles.

Progress: added the centered 400×300 container in HTML and CSS.

Files changed: index.html, styles.css
Next: Open the page in a browser to verify layout—want me to start that for you?

Prompt 2: Now, add 8 square divs inside it, each with 50px width and height, and 20px margins. 
Respuesta 2: Updating the plan then I'll add eight .square divs and the CSS rules.

Created 5 todos

Now inserting eight .square elements into center-container and adding their CSS. I'll patch index.html and styles.css.

Progress: added eight 50×50 squares with 20px margins inside the centered container.

Changed files: index.html, styles.css
Remaining: Verify layout: open the page in a browser to confirm wrapping and spacing — want me to open it now?

Prompt 3: Make the center-container class no longer a flexbox, remove its border and padding, and add relative positioning for items inside of it.
Respuesta 3: I'll update styles.css to remove flex, border and padding, and add position: relative to the container.

Patching styles.css now to remove flex/border/padding and add position: relative.

Done — center-container is no longer a flexbox, has no border or padding, and now has position: relative (file changed: styles.css). Remaining step: verify the layout in a browser — want me to open it for you?
